 * Synchronizes state (e.g. explore state, data dictionary state) with browser URL query parameters.
 *
 * Keeps state and URL in sync by:
 * - Updating URL when state changes (push/replace).
 * - Updating state when URL changes (navigation).
 * - Handling browser history events (back/forward buttons).
 *
 * Internal components:
 * 1. Pop-State Manager - Manages browser navigation events.
 * 2. Meta-Command Handler - Processes URL update commands from state.
 * 3. State-URL Sync - Coordinates bidirectional synchronization.
 *
 * Required setup:
 * - Action creators for state/URL operations.
 * - State containing command flags, URL parameters, and sync configuration.
